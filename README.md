ABCDLV Phonebook Project.

The reason for this repository is to do a proposed project for DSA Class 2024 sem 2.
To assist a Namibian telecommunications company to create an efficient phonebook,
based on basic linear data structures, to deliver reasonably efficient performance for typical phonebook operations. 

Group ABCDLV's approach is to incorporate a Linked List to store the phonebook data.
A Graphical user interface (GUI) is used to provide a user friendly way to interact with  the data.
