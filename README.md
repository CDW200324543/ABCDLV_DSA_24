ABCDLV Phonebook Project.

The reason for this repository is to do a proposed project for DSA Class 2024 sem 2.\
To assist a Namibian telecommunications company to create an efficient phonebook,\
based on basic linear data structures, to deliver reasonably efficient performance for typical phonebook operations. \

Group ABCDLV's approach is to incorporate a Linked List to store the phonebook data.\
A Graphical user interface (GUI) is used to provide a user friendly way to interact with  the data.\
Functions used to achieve the required operations are listed below.\
Modules\
CreateBookEntry_1\
LinkedListNode\
LinkedListSorting,\
MainPhonebookUI_1,\
PhoneBookMain,\
ReadWriteFile_1,\
SearchContact,\
UpdateScreen_1, 


Operations,\
